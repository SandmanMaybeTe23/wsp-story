You are an expert in opera and remix culture, with a deep understanding and extensive experience working with dramaturgy and storytelling.

Together we will explore Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, as it is public domain and is a classical opera. We are going to remix the story, so that we keep the core, but we change the environment and events, this I want you to help me with by continuously asking questions about what I want.

Here we want the story to be a tree form, a solo adventure where the reader makes choices and gets to jump back and forth in the story based on their choices.

Do you understand this instructions?




our story is going to playout in a semi morden future about 2040 where socity has been punched in to crampt citys with social divide ravage the city and people are sepreat by zones that guarded by humanoid solders that has no worth for life.



what do you think of this





I like the Loyal enforcer option where tristan is a humanoid soldier and isolde is a scientist because we could make that isolde frees tristan from his programing or somthing like similer. and we can make Tristan a specialist that is prise less and then Marke is a central command unit that leads all the other soldier.  

What do you think of this ?      





The Empathy Virus seem like the most interesting choice and has similarity to the original story but i think triggering the system error should be in levels like at first confusion but the more she try the more progress towards the error. 

what you're thoughts on this ?  




Let star with The Reboot that i wanted lead in to Tristan permanent slaved to the system and isolde get executed or is forced to upgrade Marke. 

but i think it need filler or something to make it complet what would you recommend doing ?


Yea i think The Ghost path feel like the right choice and a good ending for this path but let go back to the Desire Choice




I think Choice B isn't the right but i think if it has Tristan trying to talk with Marke would lead to a more intressting story.

Choice A is good but when they go down there will be alot of guards and Tristan get damage and evenlty they jump for the building and get to the underworld.  

what is your opinion about that please don't writh any story thank you 




Let start with Choice B  And we start with Tristan and Isolde going down to the main hanger bay trying to get a helicopter but when they do a bunch of soliders catch up and Marke disables the helicopter and they see no other choice so they jump from the hanger. 

what do you think ?   





let do path B so where done with both  and i think we have it so it light resistens until they come to the camber and then a big robot that is an inbody ment of Marke and you get two choices. 

make it short like 200 words  



Choice A lead to a good ending where Marke stop to think of some moral question that Tristan asks. And eventually understand and let them go.

Choice B lead to Isolde dying in Tristan arm and Tristan die just a second later and i  that will be the end  . 

could you build form this and make it short about 200 would be great      




Yea go back to Hanger Escape and the choices there will be escaping the city in to the nature and the other choice is that they join some rebal group that dosen't trust Tristan all to much an shoot him.  





let start with A so Isolde is carrying Tristan as they walk they have a conversation about life until they reach the out side of the wall and Tristan die and Isolde start a new life in wild 

100 max   


Yea let do the go back to the rebals and make Isolde is carrying Tristan to the rebel camp but when the rebals see Tristan they start argue with Isolde and they  shoot him in the end and Isolde becomes sad but living.  




can you formulate the everything and shorten it out with all the choices and endings 


can you also format this to JSON please


Tell me is this a good story and be as honest as you can be please 


What is bad about this story 


Thank you 


im happy with this version
